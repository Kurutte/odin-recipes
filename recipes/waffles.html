        <p>Breakfast is a special meal of the day, whether it's actually the "most" important or just an excuse to have dessert in the morning. Nevertheless, a big waffle is always a delight to see when you wake up in the morning. The pockets holding puddles of syrupy goodness, the fruit complementing every bite you take. A dollop of butter almost looks as amazing as ice cream, adding to the flavor of this fluffy cloud. It's almost a bite of heaven. And it's time for us to explore it.</p>
