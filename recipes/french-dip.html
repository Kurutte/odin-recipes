        <h3>STEPS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat. Generously salt and pepper the steak and sear it until it reaches medium rare, depending on thickness about 3 minutes each side. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak into strips, as thin as possible against the grain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized saucepan set over medium heat, whisk the beef stock, dried thyme, salt, sherry, Worcestershire, garlic and onion powder, until fully combined. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Butter the inside of each of the french or hoagie rolls and sprinkle with garlic powser and place them open faced on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven broiler on medium. Quickly dip the strips of steak into the broth and place them in even amounts onto one side of each roll. Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese on each sandwich and arrange them open face on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheet under the broiler until cheese begins to melt, watching carefully for about 2 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with parsley if desired.</li>
            <li>In small cocottes or ramekins ladle 3/4 cup serving of au jus into each container. Serve au jus with the warm sandwich and enjoy!</li>
