# odin-recipes

First Odinproject project: Create a website hosting at least 3 recipes.

The homepage should have a link to the three recipes hosted

The website should have a recipes directory holding all the recipe pages

Each recipe should have a recipe name, an image of the finished recipe, a recipe description, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps for making the dish
